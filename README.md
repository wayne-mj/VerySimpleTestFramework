# Very Simple Test Framework

This is a very simple test framework that I wrote simply because I had difficulty getting the existing ones to work or understanding how to integrate them into my projects.

Sometimes I just needed to prove that 1 + 1 = 2, or there about (1.999997 or 2.00001 for floating point errors) but scaffolding some of the existing frameworks required jumping through hoops, and setting up additional processes that it became too much of a chore, so I wrote this simple framework.

I started on it just after New Years 2025, and have been building on it since - that is why some of it may appear to be further along in some sections than in others.  I have been constantly writing and re-writing tests as I add, or reconsider how a test should be performed.  Even the way results are presented have been re-written multiple times to provide clearer feedback with future plans to expand this feedback.
